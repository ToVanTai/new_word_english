Ngày xửa ngày xưa, bên bờ biển xanh sâu thẳm, có một người ngư dân và vợ của ông sống trong một căn lều nhỏ bé. Ngày nào người chồng cũng ra biển câu cá với chiếc cần câu cũ. Ông rất bằng lòng với cuộc sống ấy, nhưng vợ ông lại không vui vẻ như vậy.

“Trời ơi, nhìn cái lều tồi tàn này đi! Ẩm mốc, dơ bẩn khắp nơi. Em chán ngán phải dọn dẹp mỗi ngày rồi!” – người vợ càu nhàu.

Người ngư dân yêu vợ tha thiết, nhưng dù có cố gắng thế nào ông cũng chẳng thể làm vợ vừa lòng. Ông đem cá về, cô lại muốn ăn cua. Ông hái táo thì cô thèm lê.

Một ngày nọ, người ngư dân vẫn như thường lệ ra biển câu cá. Ông vung cần xuống nước rồi kiên nhẫn đợi. Sau vài tiếng, đầu cần câu cuối cùng cũng rung lên.
“Ồ, cá đã cắn câu rồi! Nhưng ái chà, chắc là con cá này lì lắm!”
Ông kéo cần mãi, kéo mãi, mãi đến khi vô cùng bất ngờ thấy một con cá bơn ở đầu cần câu – con cá này màu vàng óng ánh, tỏa sáng rực rỡ.

“Cuối cùng thì ông cũng bắt được ta rồi hả, lão ngư dân?”

“Hả? Có phải... cá vừa nói chuyện với tôi không? Hay là tôi hóa điên rồi?”

“Ông nghe không nhầm đâu! Nhưng nghe này, ta không phải cá thường. Ta thực ra là một vị hoàng tử bị dính lời nguyền. Làm ơn, hãy tha cho ta! Đừng giết ta, và nếu muốn, ông cứ ước một điều gì đi, ta sẽ giúp ông thực hiện, vì ông đã cứu mạng ta.”

“Không, không, ta chưa từng thấy con cá nào biết nói cả. Dĩ nhiên ta sẽ tha cho ngươi. Thôi, trở về biển đi!”

Người ngư dân trở về nhà với niềm vui lớn.
“Ông về sớm thế này là sao? Không bắt được cá à? Cũng không mang trái cây về luôn hả?” – vợ ông hỏi.

“Không đâu vợ yêu ơi, hôm nay ta bắt được một con cá, nhưng con cá ấy biết nói! Nó tự nhận là hoàng tử!”

“Rồi... rồi sao?”

“Rồi nó bảo ta hãy ước bất cứ điều gì, nó sẽ thực hiện. Nhưng lúc đó ta sững sờ quá nên chỉ thả nó về biển luôn.”

“Ông thật không tin được! Tìm được cá thần mà không ước gì hết! Ít nhất cũng phải ước một căn nhà mới cho tôi hạnh phúc đi chứ! Quay lại biển, gặp cá đó, ước ngay cho tôi một căn nhà mới!”

Người ngư dân không từ chối nổi vợ lại ra biển.

“Cá bơn, cá bơn, hoàng tử cá ơi, tôi muốn ước một điều, xin hãy nghe tôi!”

Con cá lại trồi lên mặt nước, “Ông muốn gì vậy, lão ngư dân?”

“Vợ tôi mãi không vui – cô ấy chán phải sống trong lều rách, chỉ mong có một căn nhà khang trang thôi.”

“Thế thì về đi, nhà cô ấy mới toanh rồi đó.”

Người ngư dân chạy về, thấy vợ mình đứng trước một căn nhà đẹp lộng lẫy. Trong nhà mọi thứ đều mới, sạch bóng không vết bẩn.

“Anh ơi, từ nay chúng ta không phải sống trong cái lều rách nữa mà là ở căn nhà tuyệt vời này. Đồ đạc đều mới tinh và sạch sẽ!”

“Vâng vợ yêu, chúng ta sẽ hạnh phúc trong ngôi nhà này mãi mãi, đúng không?”

“Chưa biết được đâu anh à!”

Tối đó, vợ người ngư dân trằn trọc mãi không ngủ được. Sáng hôm sau, ngồi vào bàn ăn sáng, bà lại yêu sách tiếp:

“Anh à, em thấy nhà này vẫn quá bé với chúng ta, em muốn một căn to hơn, thực ra là một cung điện cơ! Em muốn làm... hoàng hậu! Anh hiểu không? Đi bảo cá thần cho em ngay đi!”

Dù trong lòng bối rối, người ngư dân lại ra biển:

“Cá bơn, cá bơn, hoàng tử cá ơi, tôi lại muốn ước một điều – xin hãy nghe tôi một lần nữa. Vợ tôi không vui, vì cô ấy muốn một cung điện đấy.”

“Thế thì về đi, vợ ông giờ là chủ cung điện rồi.”

Người ngư dân trở về thì choáng váng: nhà đã biến thành cung điện khổng lồ, vợ ông ngồi giữa điện trên ngai vàng lộng lẫy.

“Vợ yêu, em thực sự đã thành hoàng hậu rồi!”

“Ừ, nhưng em chưa thấy hài lòng đâu. Thực ra em muốn làm nữ hoàng của tất cả – hoàng hậu chưa đủ!”

“Nhưng mà cá cũng không thể cho em làm nữ hoàng của mọi thứ được đâu!”

“Đi hỏi cá xem, để cho nó quyết định!”

Tội nghiệp người ngư dân lại ra biển với nỗi buồn rầu.

“Cá bơn, cá bơn, hoàng tử cá ơi, tôi lại muốn ước một điều nữa – vợ tôi giờ vẫn chưa hài lòng, vì muốn làm nữ hoàng kia!”

“Thôi được rồi, ông về đi – vợ ông bây giờ là nữ hoàng!”

Lần này về đến cung điện, ông càng sửng sốt: cung điện rộng lớn hơn gấp bội, có lính canh ngoài cửa, vợ ông ngồi trên ngai vàng còn oai phong gấp nhiều lần.

“Đã là nữ hoàng rồi, em hài lòng chưa?”

“Em cũng... chưa rõ đâu, phải bàn sau nhé! Em mệt rồi, mình đi ngủ đi.”

Tối hôm đó, khi người ngư dân cầu mong vợ mình không đòi hỏi gì thêm, thì vợ ông lại trằn trọc suốt đêm, nghĩ xem còn có thể đòi hỏi gì nữa từ cá thần.

Một tuần trôi qua, bà vợ lại gọi chồng đến và yêu sách:

“Anh à, thời gian này thoắt cái trôi tuột mất. Em muốn điều khiển thời gian, em muốn sống trên mây, cai quản mặt trời, mặt trăng!”

“Sao... sao em lại muốn như thế? Bao nhiêu của cải, quyền lực thế này vẫn chưa đủ sao?”

“Nếu muốn em hạnh phúc thì hãy ra biển nói với cá thần đi!”

“Anh không làm được đâu, em dừng lại đi…”

“Chẳng lẽ anh không muốn em vui sao?”

Người ngư dân liều mình làm theo để làm vợ vui, lại ra biển:

“Cá bơn, cá bơn, hoàng tử cá ơi, tôi muốn ước một điều nữa – vợ tôi giờ vẫn chưa vui. Cô ấy muốn làm chủ thời gian, cai quản mặt trời, mặt trăng, sống trên mây.”

“Thôi được, ông về đi, vợ ông đã có mọi điều cô ấy muốn.”

Người ngư dân chạy về, nhưng lần này ông chẳng còn thấy vợ hay cung điện đâu. Nhìn lên trời, ông chỉ còn thấy những đám mây lững lờ trôi thật xa.

“Vợ ơi, em đâu rồi? Em xa anh mãi rồi sao?”

Người ngư dân lại vội vã ra biển gọi cá thần:

“Cá bơn, cá bơn, hoàng tử cá ơi, tôi chỉ muốn một điều ước nữa – vợ tôi đâu mất rồi?”

“Ta đã thực hiện điều ước của vợ ông rồi. Cô ấy chọn cai quản thời gian trên mây, vậy nên ông không thể thấy cô ấy cũng như cô ấy không thể thấy ông nữa.”

“Cá thần ơi, tôi đã cứu mạng cậu mà bản thân chẳng bao giờ ước điều gì cho mình. Tất cả đều cho vợ. Xin giúp tôi – cho tôi gặp lại vợ, và mong cô ấy thực sự hạnh phúc.”

“Được rồi, lão ngư dân, ông cứ về đi. Vợ ông bây giờ đã có mọi điều để hạnh phúc rồi.”

Người ngư dân chạy về đầy hồi hộp. Ông vô cùng ngạc nhiên khi thấy vợ mình đang đứng chờ trước căn nhà nhỏ, như thuở nào.

“Anh ơi, em đã không trân trọng những gì mình có. Ở trong căn nhà nhỏ xinh này với anh em đã hạnh phúc biết nhường nào.”

“Vợ yêu, anh cũng thương em nhiều lắm.”

Từ đó, người vợ của ngư dân hiểu rằng hạnh phúc có thể đến từ những điều nhỏ nhặt nhất. Và họ sống bên nhau hạnh phúc mãi mãi trong căn nhà nhỏ sạch sẽ, với những bữa cơm ngon mỗi ngày.

## 1. The Fisherman's Life


Once upon a time, on the shore of the deep blue sea, a fisherman and his wife were living in a tiny cottage.  
> Ngày xửa ngày xưa, bên bờ biển xanh sâu thẳm, có một ngư dân và vợ ông sống trong một túp lều nhỏ.

The fisherman used to go to the seaside every day and fish with his fishing rod.  
> Hàng ngày, người ngư dân lại ra biển và câu cá bằng cần câu của mình.

He was quite content to live like this, but his wife was not as happy as he was.  
> Ông khá hài lòng với cuộc sống như vậy, nhưng vợ ông thì không vui như ông.

"Ugh, look at that disgusting cottage! Moldy and damp everywhere. I am tired of cleaning every day," she complained.  
> "Trời ơi, nhìn cái túp lều kinh khủng kia kìa! Ẩm mốc khắp nơi. Em chán phải dọn dẹp hàng ngày lắm rồi," bà vợ than phiền.

The fisherman was very much in love with his wife, but no matter what he did, he could not make her happy.  
> Người ngư dân rất yêu vợ mình, nhưng dù ông có làm gì đi nữa, cũng không thể làm bà hạnh phúc.

If he brought her fish, she wanted crab.  
> Nếu ông mang cá về, bà lại muốn cua.

If he picked apples, she craved pears.  
> Nếu ông hái táo, bà lại thèm lê.

---

## 2. The Magic Flounder


One day, the fisherman went fishing as usual. He swung his fishing rod into the water and started to wait.  
> Một ngày nọ, người ngư dân lại đi câu như thường lệ. Ông quăng cần câu xuống nước và bắt đầu chờ đợi.

After a few hours, the tip of his fishing rod finally trembled.  
> Sau vài tiếng, đầu cần câu của ông cuối cùng cũng rung lên.

"Oh, a fish hit the hook! But ouch, this must be a stubborn big fish," he thought.  
> "Ồ, có cá cắn câu rồi! Nhưng ui, chắc đây là một con cá to và cứng đầu," ông nghĩ.

The fisherman pulled and pulled and was surprised to finally see a flounder on the tip of his fishing rod.  
> Ông kéo mãi, kéo mãi và cuối cùng ngạc nhiên khi thấy một con cá bơn ở đầu cần câu.

This fish was golden and shining brightly.  
> Con cá này có màu vàng và sáng rực rỡ.

"You finally managed to catch me, didn't you, fisherman?" said the fish.  
> "Cuối cùng thì ông cũng bắt được tôi rồi, đúng không, ông lão đánh cá?" con cá nói.

"Huh? Did you just talk to me, or am I going crazy?" asked the fisherman.  
> "Hả? Mày vừa nói chuyện với ta à, hay ta bị điên rồi?" ông lão hỏi.

"You heard right, fisherman. But listen, I'm not like the other fishes. I'm actually a prince under a spell."  
> "Ông nghe đúng rồi đó. Nhưng này, tôi không giống những con cá khác đâu. Tôi thực ra là một hoàng tử bị nguyền rủa."

"I can't believe this," said the fisherman.  
> "Ta không thể tin được," ông lão nói.

"Free me, fisherman, please don’t kill me. Make a wish and I’ll make it come true because you saved me."  
> "Hãy thả tôi ra, ông lão đánh cá, làm ơn đừng giết tôi. Ông hãy ước một điều, tôi sẽ biến điều đó thành hiện thực vì ông đã cứu tôi."

"No need. I've never seen a talking fish before. Of course, I will free you. Come on, go back to the seas," said the fisherman, letting the fish go.  
> "Không cần đâu. Ta chưa từng thấy con cá nào biết nói bao giờ. Dĩ nhiên ta sẽ thả mày về biển," ông lão nói và thả cá đi.

---

## 3. The First Wish


The fisherman returned home with great excitement.  
> Người ngư dân trở về nhà với vẻ rất phấn khích.

"Why did you come back early? Didn’t you catch fish? Couldn’t you at least bring some fruit?" his wife asked.  
> "Sao ông về sớm thế? Không bắt được cá à? Ít nhất cũng phải mang chút hoa quả về chứ?" vợ ông hỏi.

"No, darling. I caught a fish today, but that fish was talking. He told me he was actually a prince."  
> "Không đâu em. Hôm nay anh bắt được một con cá biết nói. Nó bảo nó thực ra là một hoàng tử."

"What? And what happened then?"  
> "Cái gì? Rồi sau đó sao?"

"Well, then he asked me to make a wish, but at that moment I was shocked and immediately let him back into the water."  
> "Nó bảo anh hãy ước một điều, nhưng lúc đó anh quá kinh ngạc nên thả nó về luôn."

"So you found a magic fish and left it back in the water without asking for anything? I cannot believe you! You saved his life. You could make a wish in return, like a house. Go catch that fish again and ask for a new home to make me happy!"  
> "Vậy là ông gặp được cá thần mà lại thả nó về biển mà không xin gì à? Tôi không thể tin nổi! Ông cứu nó rồi lẽ ra nó phải cho ông điều gì chứ, ví dụ như một căn nhà. Đi bắt lại và ước cho tôi một căn nhà mới đi!"

The fisherman could not refuse his wife's request and went back to the seaside.  
> Người ngư dân không thể từ chối yêu cầu của vợ, và lại ra bờ biển.

## 4. The New House


"Flounder, flounder, fish prince, I just want to make a wish. My wife is not happy at all, tired of living in a cottage. She wants a nice house."  
> "Cá bơn, cá bơn ơi, hoàng tử cá, tôi chỉ muốn ước một điều. Vợ tôi không hạnh phúc chút nào, cô ấy mệt mỏi vì phải sống trong túp lều. Cô ấy muốn một ngôi nhà đẹp."

"So go home, fisherman. She has a new home now," said the fish.  
> "Về đi ông lão, vợ ông bây giờ đã có một ngôi nhà mới rồi," cá nói.

The fisherman ran home and saw his wife standing in front of a perfect house.  
> Người ngư dân chạy về và thấy vợ mình đứng trước một căn nhà hoàn hảo.

The inside of the house was full of brand new furniture and everywhere was immaculate.  
> Bên trong nhà đầy đủ đồ đạc mới tinh, mọi thứ đều sạch sẽ.

"Oh, husband, we will no longer live in a cottage but in a wonderful house, and everything is new and clean," his wife said.  
> "Chồng ơi, từ nay chúng ta sẽ không phải sống trong túp lều nữa mà là một ngôi nhà tuyệt vời, mọi thứ đều mới và sạch sẽ!" vợ ông nói.

"Yes, my wife. Now we can live happily ever after in this house, right?"  
> "Đúng vậy vợ yêu, giờ chúng ta có thể sống hạnh phúc mãi mãi trong căn nhà này nhé?"

"We can never know that, my darling," she replied.  
> "Ai mà biết được hả chồng yêu," bà đáp lại.

## 5. The Wish for a Palace - Lời ước cung điện


That night, the fisherman's wife could not sleep. As soon as the morning came, she made another request from her husband at the breakfast table.  
> Tối hôm đó, vợ người đánh cá không thể chợp mắt. Sáng ra, vừa ngồi vào bàn ăn sáng, bà lại yêu cầu chồng:

"Husband, this house seems too small for us. I want a bigger house, even a palace."  
> "Chồng ơi, nhà này vẫn còn bé quá với ta. Ta muốn một ngôi nhà lớn hơn, thậm chí là một cung điện."

"What?"  
> "Gì cơ?"

"I want to be a queen. Don’t you understand? Go and tell that to the fish prince."  
> "Em muốn làm hoàng hậu. Anh không hiểu à? Mau đi nói với hoàng tử cá đi."

The fisherman went to the seaside with thoughts in his head.  
> Người ngư dân lại ra biển, trong đầu đầy những suy nghĩ.

"Flounder, flounder, fish prince, I just want to make a wish. My wife is not happy at all. She wants to have a palace."  
> "Cá bơn, cá bơn ơi, hoàng tử cá, tôi muốn ước một điều. Vợ tôi không hạnh phúc chút nào. Cô ấy muốn có một cung điện."

"So go home, fisherman. Your wife now lives in a palace," said the fish.  
> "Thôi, về nhà đi người đánh cá. Giờ vợ ông đã sống trong một cung điện rồi," cá nói.

When the fisherman returned, he saw that there was now a huge palace where his house was, and his wife was sitting on a huge throne in the palace hall.  
> Về đến nhà, ông thấy ngay một cung điện nguy nga thay cho ngôi nhà cũ; vợ ông đang ngồi trên ngai vàng lớn giữa đại sảnh.

"My darling, you really have become a queen," he said.  
> "Em yêu, em đúng là đã trở thành hoàng hậu rồi."

"Yes."  
> "Đúng."

"So, are you happy now?"  
> "Thế giờ em hạnh phúc chưa?"

"No. I actually want to be the empress, not the queen."  
> "Chưa đâu. Thực ra em muốn làm nữ hoàng, chứ không chỉ là hoàng hậu."

"What? A fish can't make you an empress. Do you understand?"  
> "Cái gì? Một con cá thì không thể biến em thành nữ hoàng được đâu, hiểu không?"

"Let the fish prince decide that. Come on, go ask the fish to make me the empress."  
> "Để hoàng tử cá quyết định đi. Mau đi hỏi cá, bảo nó làm cho em thành nữ hoàng đi!"

The poor fisherman went to the seaside sadly to make his wife happy.

"Flounder, flounder, fish prince, I just want to make a wish. My wife is still not happy. She wants to be an empress."  
> "Cá bơn, cá bơn ơi, hoàng tử cá, tôi chỉ muốn ước một điều. Vợ tôi vẫn chưa hạnh phúc. Cô ấy muốn làm nữ hoàng."

"So go home, fisherman. Your wife is now an empress," said the fish.  
> "Về đi ông lão, vợ ông giờ đang là nữ hoàng rồi," cá đáp.

When the fisherman came running back, he could not believe his eyes. The palace was now much larger than before. There were guards at the door, and his wife was now sitting on a more glorious throne as an empress.  
> Về tới nơi, ông không tin nổi vào mắt mình: cung điện còn lớn hơn trước, có lính canh cửa, và vợ ông ngồi trên ngai vàng lộng lẫy hơn, đường bệ của một nữ hoàng.

"Oh, my darling, you really have become an empress."  
> "Em yêu, em thực sự đã thành nữ hoàng rồi."

"Yes."  
> "Ừ."

"So, are you happy now?"  
> "Thế bây giờ em vui rồi chứ?"

"Hmm, I don't know. We'll talk about it later. I'm so tired today. We better sleep now."  
> "Hmm, em cũng không biết nữa. Để sau hãy nói. Hôm nay em mệt quá rồi, đi ngủ thôi."

## 7. Ambition Has No End - Tham vọng không có điểm dừng

A week passed. The woman called her husband before her and made a request.  
> Một tuần sau, bà lại gọi chồng đến và nói:

"Husband, time keeps running out. I want to control time. I want to live above the clouds and rule the sun and the moon."  
> "Chồng ơi, thời gian cứ trôi đi mãi. Em muốn kiểm soát thời gian. Em muốn sống trên mây, làm chủ cả mặt trời và mặt trăng."

"What?"  
> "Gì cơ?"

## 9. The Ending - Kết truyện


Finally, when the wife asked to become the ruler of the sun and the moon, the fisherman returned to the sea for the last time. The sea was dark, stormy, and angry.  
> Cuối cùng, khi bà vợ đòi làm chủ mặt trời và mặt trăng, người đánh cá lại ra biển lần cuối. Biển tối đen, sóng gió cuồn cuộn, nổi giận.

He called the fish, but there was no answer. He called louder, but the sea only roared louder. When he returned home, everything was gone – the palace, the guards, the furniture.  
> Ông gọi cá, nhưng chẳng ai trả lời. Ông gọi lớn hơn, biển chỉ càng gầm lên. Khi trở về, mọi thứ biến mất – cung điện, lính canh, bàn ghế.

He and his wife were back in their humble, old cottage just like before.  
> Hai vợ chồng lại trở về với túp lều cũ kỹ, đơn sơ như trước.
